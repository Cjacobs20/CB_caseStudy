        <h1>The Problem:</h1>
        <p>For those who share a strong passion for sustainability and strongly dislike how much waste is produced in our society&apos;s consumer culture, we decided on making an app that helps users buy, sell, and donate household items within their community. </p>
        <h1>The Solution:</h1>
        <p>Create a product that makes it as simple as possible for users to sell or donate clutter around their house to reduce waste, with an included insentive of helping and connecting with members of their community.</p>
        <h1>Our Project at a Glance:</h1>
        <p>The primary goal of this project was to create an application which would offer our user, Sally Jefferson the easiest and most sustainable avenue in which she could reduce clutter within her household and in turn give back to her community and make a quick buck.</p>

        <div data-bs-spy="scroll" data-bs-target="#navbar-example2" data-bs-offset="0" class="scrollspy-example" tabindex="0">
            <h1 id="scrollspyHeading1">User Research:</h1>
            <p>Based on a proto-persona created to meet our likely demographic, a user interview plan was created then conducted with 5 seperate users. As user researchers, we wanted to;</p>
              <ol>
                <li> Understand what features current resale services on the market users enjoyed the most, </li>
                <li> Get a general pulse on how, how often, why and where users may declutter their home currently, </li>
                <li> And finally determine what potential opportunities can be capitalized on in order to alleviate any pain points the user may have in not accomplishing these tasks.</li>
              </ol>
                <p>An auxilliary Instagram survey was aslo conducted to cast an even wider net to gauge our demographich. Key findings were synthesized into an affinity diagram, which aided in a sharper image of our user, funnelling into a full user persona. </p>
        
        </div> 

            <h1 id="scrollspyHeading2">Definition and Synthesis:</h1>
            <p>With insights gleaned from our user research, we then began difining our problem, landing with the problem statement as follows;
              <br>
              <em> Community Basket was designed to achieve sustainable offloading of users lightly-used household items to other users who are looking to save some money. We have observed that current services on the market arenâ€™t keeping services local, which is causing unnecessary burning of fossil fuel in shipping to our business. How might we improve distance travelled between buyer and seller so that our customers are successful based on both ease of item transfer and distance travelled by item?</em> 
            </p>

          
            <h1 id="scrollspyHeading3">Ideation:</h1>
            <p>With a clearer idea of theapplication we aimed to build in mind, we then outlined a story board of how a user discovering our service might look. A user flow was then created to outline how the basic flow through Homegrown should go, which would then be used as the blueprint for our initial wireframing.</p>
            
            <h1 id="scrollspyHeading4">Prototyping:</h1>
            <p>Lofi wireframes were first quickly created by each individual on my team, to gather some base, unbiased impressions of each designers thinking. These individual renderings were then compared, contrasted and discussed, to identify the pieces we wanted to keep and glue together. Once this was decided, the amalgum was formed into a sigle, mid-fidelty prototype for usability testing to be performed on. After usability was completed, key learings were identified and implemented into a "final" ( a designers work is never done) prototype.</p>
            
            <h1 id="scrollspyHeading5">Testing:</h1>
            <p>Testing provided many insights to be implemented in our configuration. some of these insights included; application of side scrolling to free up space, changing color consistencies, expanding the loading screen during the plant ID function to help the user understand what was occurring, to name the major ones  </p>
                
            <h1 id="scrollspyHeading6">Conclusion:</h1>
            <p>While our UX process proved highly fruitful for understanding our user needs and testing affirmed those needs and fixed others, the final product could have been better fleshed out given more time. We conducted a rather extensive competitor analysis, which could have bread more handsome visual design of our product. That aside, the functionallity fully executed the tasks me and my team identified to be most important to the user, and therefore, I believe this product was ultimately a success.</p>
